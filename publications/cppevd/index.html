      The collection of personal protective equipment (PPE) violation data is crucial for assessing safety risks in
      behavior-based safety (BBS) management on construction sites. Owing to the limitations of manual inspection
      methods, many studies have employed computer vision‚Äìbased methods for PPE violation detection. However,
      limitations exist
      in implementing this in actual construction projects due to the costs associated with the acquisition and labeling
      of
      a large number of images, and the accuracy and efficiency of recording PPE violation data. Therefore, this study
      introduces semisupervised object detection (SS-OD) and data augmentation for training PPE detection models to
      reduce the use of labeled data without reducing the performance, and proposes a framework for recording the PPE
      violation
      data by extracting PPE violation videos from real-time surveillance footage by considering the role of the worker
      and
      their position, thereby enhancing practical construction management and serving as input for BBS-based safety risk
      assessments on construction sites. The results show that (1) the labeled data demand for training PPE detection
      models can be
      reduced through semisupervised learning, image augmentation, and transfer learning, without reducing the
      performance of PPE detection, thereby reducing the cost of application on actual construction sites; (2) SS-OD
      methods are better
      equipped to handle changes in construction scenarios by making full use of unlabeled data, and thus are suitable
      for construction scenarios; and (3) recording PPE violation data using the video clip method in a real
      construction
      project achieved an average precision of 91.76% and an average ùêπ‚Å¢1 score of 92.79%. Using the PPE detection model
      trained
      with SS-OD effectively records PPE violation data for BBS-based safety risk assessment. This study significantly
      enhances the efficiency of real construction site PPE violation inspections and provides a valuable method for the
      automated
      and real-time collection of violation data in BBS-based management.
